Description: Microsoft Windows Compatibility Layer (32-bit support)
 Wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux.
 Applications are run at full speed without the need of cpu emulation. Wine
 does not require Microsoft Windows, however it can use native system dll
 files in place of its own if they are available.
 .
 This package includes a program loader for running unmodified Windows
 executables as well as the Wine project's free version of the Windows API for
 running programs ported from Windows.
 .
 This package provides support for loading 32-bit x86 Windows applications
